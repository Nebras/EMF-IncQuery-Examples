# BPMN2 IncQuery Example

Note: this is an incomplete example as of 2012.06.07. as the BPMN2 metamodel and the editor seem to be too buggy.

## Prerequisites
* recent Eclipse Indigo Modeling
* Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler http://www.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/
** Update site: http://download.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/site

## Usage

* try loading the .bpmn file from the .instancemodel project, only the BPMN Model editor will work with the Query Explorer
* try loading the sample .eiq from the .incquery project
* various exceptions will be thrown :-)
