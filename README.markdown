Example projects for EMF-IncQuery
=================================

Repository rules
----------------

 * Sort the folder hierarchy according to the "metamodel-on-top" rule, i.e. the domains (school, petrinet, etc) come as top-level folders and below these come the code etc. contents.
 * Add instance models as well, to aid testing.
 * Always include a README.markdown file in each top-level folder and also everywhere else where necessary, to aid others' understanding.
